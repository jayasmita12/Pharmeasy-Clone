# PHARMEASY-CLONE
Cloning of PharmEasy Website

Take it easy, PharmEasy - You must have heard this phrase during TV ads. Let's dive deep into this healthcare website and clone it.

Hello, we are writing this blog to share our team's experience of cloning a website named "PharmEasy". Pharmeasy is an Indian healthcare app and ecommerce platform for consumers involved in selling online medicines, diagnostics, telehealth, online doctor consultation services. PharmEasy offers 1 lakh+ medicines and health products across various categories through its retail partners which are spread across the country. You can simply place an order on our website/app and we will deliver your online medicine order in as low as 4 hours, with a guaranteed delivery to you in 24–48* hrs!
You can either pay online or opt for COD (cash on delivery) for your orders.

Our team created clone of PharmEasy within a week.Our group consists of four members: Bharath, Rahul,Jayasmita sahu, Ashish Kumar Prajapati,Aritra De and raju prajapati

Concepts we are used to clone this website:

1.HTML

2.CSS

3.JavaScript

4.Bootstrap

5.MongoDB

6.Node.js

7.Express.js

We used the following resources:

1.http://bootstrap.com

2.https://fontawesome.com/

3.https://mdn.com

4.https://pharmeasy-clone.herokuapp.com/covids

We tried our best to create perfect cloned site, at first we decided to complete the user flow of the project that is user should see home page of the website,user should be able to signup and signin and user should be able to access the contents after completing the payment process.

CHALLENGES WE FACED AND HOW WE SOLVED THEM

This is the third time to work on a project remotely with a team. We faced some challenges during completion of this project.

We started the project by creating a slack channel which is first and most important task that is connecting with our teammates.This workspace where we can share our work or our ideas.

Followed by that we scheduled our first zoom meeting on first day where we discussed how we can further proceed during this whole construct week. We researched the whole website and divided tasks for each.

Our next challenge was to record the data of how and how many tasks had been completed by each team member so we decided to schedule a meeting two times in a day and in morning meeting we used to decide what task to do today and in evening we solved each other's problems hence completed the task of the day.

We used mongodb which is a backend database of our Project.MongoDB is the leading modern, general purpose database platform, designed to unleash the power of software and data for developers and the applications they build.

Moving further, GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. We are using Github Repository. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. You'll create your own project repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

The project has been deployed to Netlify,.It unites an entire ecosystem of modern tools and services into a single, simple workflow for building high performance sites and apps.

Further proceeding forward, we were facing issues whenever we require some additional concepts which are not a part of this unit but necessary to build this project. To overcome this we skipped some parts and also learned new concepts from internet and applied them wherever required.

After crossing each and every obstacles, we finally completed the cloning of the Pharmeasy website.
